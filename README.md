# Ada-Hack
Ada Hackathon 2022-Twitter API project

The S.A.W.D.U.S.T. Cloud Team uses the Twitter API to search recent Tweets containing a specific word. Then finds common words in tweets containing that original search term, their frequency and average sentiment of the Tweets they appear in. Data is presented to the user through size (indicating frequency of the word appearance) and colour (indicating sentiment towards the word) variables in a wordcloud.

The result is a broad view on social trends, which can be very useful in detecting prejudices and biases.
